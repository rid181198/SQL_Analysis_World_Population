# SQL_Analysis_World_Population

In this project, we'll work with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like:

population - The population as of 2015. population_growth - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage. area - The total land and water area.

In this project, we'll use SQL in Jupyter Notebook to explore and analyze data from this database.

Database:
The dataset is quite simple and will not allow us to answer complicated question. It is composed of 11 colums and 262 row.

id - id number attribuated to a country.
code - country code, made from the two first letters of the country.
area - total area of the country (area_water + area_land).
population - population of the country
population_growth - ratio of the population growth in 2015
birth_rate
death_rate
migration_rate - ratio of people that left the country to another.
